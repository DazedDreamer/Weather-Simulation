#     Project Proposal

##  IDEA

The main idea behind my final project for this class is an audio-visual customizable **Weather  Simulation**, encompassing various attributes of weather such as rain, snow, wind, thunder, sunlight etc. Moreover, to render the whole simulation realistic, firstly I will put in **wind** as a contributing factor which will affect the aforementioned weather attributes. Secondly, I will introduce **objects** that will be **affected by these conditions, such as plants, trees, clothes** etc. Moreover, this project will lend at the user's disposal complete liberty to **play around with different parameters** such as the **intensity** of each of the weather attributes, their **sounds**, **on/off toggle buttons** for each one of rain/snow/thunder/wind/sunlight,  allowing the user to **visualize different weather patterns.** 


## Libraries/Add-Ons

>For sound effects, I'll be referring to  [this](http://openframeworks.cc/documentation/sound/)

>[This](https://reso-nance.org/wiki/_media/logiciels/openframeworks/ofbook.pdf) is solely for reference purposes during the development process

>[This](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/ofxFluid) library will be for controlling the interactions of the thunder and lightning

>Multiple libraries from [here](http://ofxaddons.com/categories/1-gui) for GUI

>[This](https://github.com/armadillu/ofxExplosion) would be for explosions during dramatic outburst of lightning

>[This](https://github.com/memo/ofxMSAPhysics) for collisions

>[This](https://github.com/jvelazqueztraut/ofxPhysical) accelerating the motions of particles(rain, snow etc.)
