# CS 126 FinalProject
##    Project Title

My project is essentially a real-time weather simulation, encompassing various attributes of weather such as wind, rain, thunder, and snow. It is completely extendable in that others can use it as a foundation to work upon.

## Motivation

Since the time the final project was introduced to us in class by the Professor, I was quite adamant about creating some kind of a **graphics or data visualization or simulation**. Moreover, due to Illinois's weather undergoing major fluctuations, and its unusual weather patterns, I thought it would be intriguing and exciting to model a weather simulation of my own, with **complete liberty to manipulate different attributes of weather**.

## Framework/Platform/Language Used
This project was built using **C++ in Xcode** with libraries and add-ons from **Openframeworks**.

## How to use?
Once you get the code up and running, there's a **control panel on the top left** where you can change and play around with the different attributes of weather. If a trackpad doesn't suit your fancy, no problem! You have the **liberty to use your keyboard too!** Simply **press 'h'** to look up the instructions manual which informs you what key serves what purpose.
